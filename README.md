 A large data set with 79 different features (like living area, number of rooms, location, etc.) and their prices are provided for residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The challenge is to learn a relationship between the essential features and the price and predict the prices of a new set of houses.

this model predicts the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, we must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.
